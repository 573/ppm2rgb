* [Solved] Static compilation not needed in our case, for reference only: `ghc-options: -static -optl-static -optl-pthread` and `Flag static` added, rpms providing the .a file versions of the libraries (gmp, rt etc.) installed on the build system (glibc-devel, glibc-static), but resulting binary doesnt run on remote machine, raises `kernel too old` error. Compiling against dietlibc-devel or uClibc-devel didnt help either (`extra-lib-dirs:` and `include-dirs:` entries in .cabal file as well as special `if flag(static)` `ghc-options: ...-optl-gmp`, `cabal configure -fstatic`), while stucked building with a pthreads-related error (keywords: uClibc, pthreads, TLS).
